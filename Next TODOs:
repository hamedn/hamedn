1. Calculate new census values (Fall 2017/census_new.csv)
2. Calculate environment features (Modeling/zip_features_new.csv)
    *Missing: older, food environment data
3. Merge them into final table using Calculate User Features
	****Missing: Food Categories


zip_features_final.csv




Next TODOs:

* Run Calculate User Features to get new table of soda, fastfood, etc.
* Groupby common_user_id and export and zip table and user table


* Go through rest of the pipeline 
	--> Check to make sure we have environmental data for all of the zipcodes
	* Make sure to merge in newly calculated education measure
